        <p>IU Mobile serves nearly 200,000 students, faculty, and staff every year, providing access to essential campus resources such as real-time bus tracking. While this feature is highly used, recurring user feedback revealed frustration with buried information and an overcrowded route list that made relevant buses difficult to find. To address these issues, I led a redesign of the bus map experience by translating user feedback into actionable design improvements.</p>

                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Bus tracking is one of the most frequently used features in IU Mobile, yet user feedback consistently pointed to friction in everyday use. Critical information such as arrival times was hidden behind secondary interactions, and the full list of bus routes created visual clutter that made prioritizing relevant routes difficult. As a result, users often struggled to get the information they needed quickly while on the move.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Understanding User Needs</h2>
                    <p>As a student intern on IU Mobile's design team, I was often asked to weigh in on how students might use or respond to new features. While I was able to provide insights from my perspective, I wanted to ensure design decisions were grounded in more than my own experience. To better understand how students actually used IU Mobile, and where friction existed, I proactively gathered direct user feedback to inform future design work.</p>

                    <h3>Collecting User Feedback</h3>
                    <div class="two-column-container text-image-layout">
                        <div class="two-column">
                            <p>I created a lightweight feedback form to collect qualitative input from students about their experiences with IU Mobile. The form focused on how they use IU Mobile and areas of friction they encountered, with questions like:</p>
                            <ul class="project-bullets">
                                <li>What is your affiliation with IU (student, faculty, or staff)?</li>
                                <li>How often do you use IU Mobile?</li>
                                <li>What is your favorite thing about IU Mobile?</li>
                                <li>What is your <strong></strong>least</strong> favorite thing about IU Mobile?</li>
                                <li>What is something you wish IU Mobile could do that it currently cannot do?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I distributed the form through informal student channels like social media and group chats, allowing me to quickly gather candid, experience-driven responses.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Feedback Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I used Excel to perform descriptive statistical analysis on the feedback data, revealing overall trends in usage and satisfaction. This quantitative data helped establish a baseline understanding of who this feedback was coming from and how they were using the app, contextualizing the qualitative insights from the open-ended responses.</p>

                    <p>Taken together, the quantitative results suggested that IU Mobile was broadly useful, but they did not capture how users experienced the app in real-world, time-sensitive moments. By synthesizing open-ended feedback, clearer patterns began to emerge around information visibility, navigation, and prioritization.</p>

                <h2>Designing the Solution</h2>
                <p>With a clear understanding of where users were experiencing friction, I began exploring design solutions that could meaningfully improve the bus tracking experience. I focused my design efforts on opportunities to reduce friction, improve clarity, and better support time-sensitive use cases. Additionally, I wanted this work to lay a foundation for future map features like a bus route home screen widget.</p>

                        <p>To help users quickly find the routes they care about, I explored introducing a favorites system that would surface frequently used buses and reduce visual clutter.</p>

                            <li><strong>Favorites control:</strong> Add or remove routes from a personalized favorites list.</li>
                            <li><strong>Route details access:</strong> Users were often unaware of the details screen, so I proposed adding a button for better discoverability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Entire card acts as display toggle:</strong> Allow the entire route card to act as an on/off toggle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> Introduce lightweight guidance for new interactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While the favorites concept resonated with design stakeholders, the extent of interaction changes and reliance on onboarding conflicted with existing design principles. I used this feedback to iterate on the design and move toward a more intuitive solution.</p>

                    <div class="two-column">
                        <p>Following the initial round of feedback, I refined the route card layout and began designing cards for bus stops. I also explored how these cards would fit into the broader context of the map screen.</p>
                        <ul class="project-bullets">
                            <li><strong>Updated favorites interaction:</strong> The favorite and route details buttons were moved to the bottom of the route card to maintain the existing interaction pattern.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adding bus stop cards:</strong> Since users often rely on bus stops more than routes, I designed cards for bus stops that include all routes that service the stop.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exploring broader interactions:</strong> I separated the list view into three sections: favorites, routes, and bus stops. This allows users to quickly navigate to the information they need.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These designs were met with positive feedback from both the design and development teams, who only requested minor visual adjustments. Reviewers also encouraged me to design for additional system states.</p>

                <h3>Final Design Solution</h3>
                <p>Using feedback from design and development reviews, I iterated on the proposed solution to refine key interactions and add additional system states.

                <h2>Feedback &amp; Handoff</h2>
                <p>This project was iterative in nature, involving weekly design reviews and multiple meetings with developers to ensure usability and feasibility. I presented these work-in-progress designs to gather feedback, clarify requirements, and surface potential implementation challenges early. This collaborative review process helped ensure the final solution was ready for implementation.</p>

                <p>After final approval, I prepared detailed design documentation and implementation requirements in Jira. This included an annotated Figma file, acceptance criteria, Google Analytics specifications, and haptic requirements. I prioritized the "why" behind the solution to help the development team understand the context and intent behind the design decisions.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Status &amp; Next Steps</h2>
                <p>The design has been approved and is currently in development. As the development team is working to implement the design, I will be providing ongoing support and feedback as they progress.</p>
                <p>This work is laying a foundation for possible future features like favorites in other categories (buildings, parking lots, food, etc.) and a home screen widget for favorite bus routes. These will provide more opportunities for users to have a frictionless experience when they need to find information quickly.</p>

                <h2>Reflection &amp; Takeaways</h2>
                <p>This project represented my most end-to-end contribution to IU Mobile, from early user feedback through final handoff for development. It challenged me to think beyond individual screens and consider how design decisions affected the broader system, technical implementation, and long-term product direction.</p>
